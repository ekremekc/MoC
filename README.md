# Method of Characteristics

## Supersonic Nozzle Design

Method Of Characteristic has been utilized to generate two dimensional minimum length nozzle contour. **MoC_Nozzle_Design.py** allows to generate wall points and export it into text file. **numericmethods.py** script includes the numerical methods that has been used to determine the root of Prandtl-Meyer angles of characteristics.

**moc_sym_mach.py** and **moc_sym_temp.py** files can generate contour plots of temperature and Mach number by pulling generated **csv** files located in **point_folder** file.
